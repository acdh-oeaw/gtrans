# Basic info about a django models

The actual data model is described in [this gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J_TPEl77lCaDPKocJAj0aVPzWcoQbtWDFyBv1BXzbdA/edit?usp=sharing)

## Tables/Classes

* each sheet describes one database table (aka class)
* *field name* is used as internal name, needs to follow specific naming conventions, not visible to anyone who does not read the application's source code.
* *verbose name* provides the visible name.
* *helptext* used to store a (short) explanation/definition of this field/property, can e.g. be displayed as helptext next to a form field.
* *field type* defines the type of the field -> see below.


## fields/properties

* [CharField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.CharField) is used to store *short* texts (strings). In the edit/create interface such a field will be displayed as an input field (usually ony one line long)
* [TextField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.TextField) is used to store texts (strings), no matter how long they are. In the edit/create interface such a field will be displayed as input field covering several lines.
* [FloatField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#floatfield) is used to store a floating point number. Will be displayed as input field accepting numbers only.
* [DateField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.DateField) is used to store a date matching this pattern *YYYY-MM-DD*. In the edit/create interface such a field could be displayed as simple input field or as some kind of calendar, where users can select a date.
* [FK](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#foreignkey) stands for a *Foreign Key* relation, meaning that this field stores the primary key of the related class. In the edit/create interface such a field will be displayed as drop-down list or as an autocomplete field
* [M2M](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#manytomanyfield) stand for *Many to Many* relation, meaning that this field stores 0:n primary keys of related classe. In the edit/create interface such a field will be displayed as drop-down list with the otpion so select multiple lines or as an autocomplete field, again with the option to select multiple rlated objects.
